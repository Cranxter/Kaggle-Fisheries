# Kaggle-Fisheries

My solution to the Kaggle <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring"> Natural Fisheries Competition </a>. It achieved a LB score of 1.1 <br>
Due to college coursework I couldn't make further modifications to improve the score. I had planned to do the following, which would have surely given me a <1 LB loss score.
<ul>
<li> Use Ensemble of several models  </li>
<li> Augmenting the Images </li>
</ul>
